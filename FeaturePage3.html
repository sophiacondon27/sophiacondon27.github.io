                        American graphic designer Saul Bass was known for his involvement 
                        with the film industry, creating title sequences and movie posters 
                        for iconic works. He also designed many familiar logos and was an 
                        Oscar-winning filmmaker himself. He was an active artist for 40 years
                        and collaborated with legendary filmmakers. Bass remains one of the 
                        most influential graphic designers of the twentieth century and is 
                        credited with the establishment of modern title sequence design as 
                        a respected art form. Starting as a freelancer and commercial artist, 
                        he became a significant figure in both the entertainment industry and 
                        the world of advertising. Here is an outline of his career as an 
                        artist and quintessential examples of his posters and title sequences.
